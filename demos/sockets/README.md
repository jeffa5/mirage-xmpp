# Sockets demo

This demo is largely a copy of the code from the mirage.io website for setting up a connection.

The `build-and-run` script builds the unikernel, starting it and then waiting for a `SIGINT` (`ctrl-c`) signal before cleaning up the directory.

The `test` script can be used to simply send data to the unikernel.
